# FitForge Frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository of FitForge, a web application dedicated to creating and managing workout routines for gym enthusiasts. This part of the application is built using `Vue.js` and `TypeScript`, offering a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of FitForge's frontend up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Follow these steps to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

To get your development environment running:

1. Clone the FitForge frontend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ksaphier/fitforge_frontend.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fitforge_frontend
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   After following these steps, you'll have a local copy of the project ready for development and testing.

## Running the Application

After installing all the necessary dependencies, you can run the FitForge frontend in development mode. Here's how you can start the application:

1. To run the development server, use the following Yarn command:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
2. Once the server starts, the application should be available at http://localhost:5173 by default.

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the application.

This will launch the FitForge frontend in a development environment with hot-reloading enabled, meaning any changes you make to the source code will be immediately reflected in the browser.

## Built With

The FitForge frontend is built with a combination of modern technologies and frameworks to ensure a robust and efficient user experience. Here's a list of the major components:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - An approachable, performant, and versatile framework for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.

These tools and frameworks were chosen to provide an efficient, scalable, and developer-friendly environment for building the FitForge frontend.
